            <p>
                DangerLine is a simple yet captivating 3D stealth game where sound and lighting take center stage in guiding
                players through a heavily surveilled cityscape. Players embark on an auditory journey, following an
                evolving, drone-like sound that serves as their sole companion and directional guide.

            <p>The web build is a work in progress and will have some sizing issues until fixed. As of now, the pause menu doesn't work properly due to the original code being intended for a Windows executable.</p>
